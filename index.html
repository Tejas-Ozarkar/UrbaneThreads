            </div>
            <div class="subtext">
                    All you need to know about organic!
 
                    When we say that we want you to go organic with us, we would first like you to actually know the conventional reasons behind this. Though the issue of organic cotton often goes behind unheard ears, we strongly feel that it is high time it should be stressed upon now. 
                    Organic cotton is produced as per Global Organic Textile Standard. 
                    
                    Organic farming uses natural process rather than the artificial inputs, sustaining the health of soils, ecosystems and people. Organic cotton farming forbids the use of toxic chemicals or genetically modified Seed. Rather,it combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote a good quality of life for all involved.

                    What is Fairtrade?
            </div>
            <div class="subtext">
                    In 2009, Fairtrade International along with the world fairtrade organization adopted the charter of fairtrade principles, which provides a single international reference point for Fairtrade. 

                    With fairtrade farmers can make their own decisions and control their futures. It is about better prices, decent working conditions and fair terms of trades for farmers and workers. It works in favour of the most marginalised group globally. 
                    
                    The Mark means that the Fairtrade organic cotton in the product have been produced by small-scale farmer organisations or plantations that meet Fairtrade social, economic and environmental standards. The standards include protection of workersâ€™ rights and the environment, payment of the Fairtrade Minimum Price and an additional Fairtrade Premium to invest in business or community projects.
                    Urbane Thread follows these standards in the production of these clothings and all it's products meet the fairtrade standards.
